Expenses App

# Description:
This app helps you to manage expenses by simply recording and checking every purchase you make. 
It has a simple and understandable interface which allows to add new expenses, check and filter already 
added ones. The app includes the chart which helps to see total month expenses. In the production were used 
such technologies as React.js, Npm, GitHub, Chrome Developer Tools, VS Code. The app is written with HTML, CSS 
and JavaScript programming language. One of the main challenges while building the app was understanding and implementing
states, lifting states up. This app can be updated in the future by adding categories of expenses etc.
